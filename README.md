# Arduino-remote-car

Arduino for remote control car. 

This program is implemented for a Bluetooth remote control car using Arduino board. 
This implementation has two modes. One is Bluetooth remote controlled and the other is autonomous, which can solve a simple maze.

## What you need
1. Arduino uno
2. Ultrasonic Module HC-SR04 HC-SR04P Distance Measuring Sonar Sensor for Arduino x 2
3. Bluetooth module for Arduino
4. Wires
5. Arduino breadboard

Note that to build a remote control car, you would also need wheels, chassis and batteries. 

## How to run
1. Install the software Arduino from https://www.arduino.cc/
2. Install library NewPing in Arduino
3. Connect Arduino uno to computer
4. run the program in Arduino
5. Wire all the components (you would need to check the program to see which pin to connect)
6. you would also need Arduino bluetooth controller on your phone to controller the car.
